# CS250-Agile-Retrospective

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
This is primarily done through the interactions with the sprint team based on the user conversations that the product owner brings. The user stories provide a framework of who is the actor, what they are looking for, and why they are looking to preform a specific task or requirement. "As a X, I want to Y, so that I can Z."

##How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I always like to have my requirements clearly labeled so that I can use them as a checklist. One of the dicussions was about time estimation and management and I believe doing the exercises such as the poker method would be helpful in deciding what tasks are overarching or immediately needed.

##What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think it really boils down to communication, being open and honest about your work, and ownership of your scope responsibilities.
